        <h1>Leo Messi: The Legend who never gave up</h1>

        <h2 id="section1">Argentina</h2>
        <p>           Lionel Messi has been a key player for the Argentina national team for over a decade. He has scored 103 goals in 175 appearances, making him the country's all-time leading scorer. Messi has helped Argentina win the Copa América in 2021 and 2022, as well as the 2022 FIFA World Cup. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="section2">Barcelona</h2>
        <p>
            In the 2004–05 season Messi, then 17, became the youngest official player and goal scorer in the Spanish La Liga (the country’s highest division of football). Though only 5 feet 7 inches (1.7 metres) tall and weighing 148 pounds (67 kg), he was strong, well-balanced, and versatile on the field. Naturally left-footed, quick, and precise in control of the ball, Messi was a keen pass distributor and could readily thread his way through packed defenses. In 2005 he was granted Spanish citizenship, an honour greeted with mixed feelings by the fiercely Catalan supporters of Barcelona.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section3">PSG</h2>
        <p>
            in 2021 Messi signed with Paris St.-Germain (PSG), where he joined superstars Kylian Mbappé and Neymar, and that year he received yet another Ballon d’Or. He helped PSG win the Ligue 1 title in each of his two seasons with the team.
